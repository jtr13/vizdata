The complete list of output columns is as follows. Columns not initially visible can be viewed by clicking the Column Visibility button. Output columns package name of package (optional) name name of dataset nr_or_len number of rows or length() (whichever is not NULL) nc number of columns add_dim additional dimensions (&gt;= 3, such as for tables) first_class first class listed n_cols number of numeric columns i_cols number of integer columns f_cols number of factor columns c_cols number of character columns d_cols number of date columns other_cols number of other columns missing proportion of missing values overall allclasses full list of classes (optional) Table columns can be sorted and filtered. Dataset names are linked to documentation if available. Datasets without links are usually included in documentation for a dataset in the same package with a similar name. For example, documentation for alr4::BGSboys and alr4::BGSgirls is included on the help page for alr4::BGSall. 1.2 Exploring data in packages locally The main function used here is data_xray() from the datacat package. You can explore datasets in R packages locally as follows. Install datacat: remotes::install_github(&quot;jtr13/datacat&quot;) View information with: library(datacat) data_xray(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) %&gt;% View() 1.3 Contributing I welcome your suggestions on packages to add to this resource. You can either open an issue or add the package name to this file and create a pull request. I have intentionally left out packages with nondescriptive dataset names such as ch5ex11: AMCP, [Devore7] If you think this is a mistake, I’m open to discussion on the topic.

Several methods are provided for the analysis (i.e., ordination) of one-table (e.g., principal component analysis, correspondence analysis), two-table (e.g., coinertia analysis, redundancy analysis), three-table (e.g., RLQ analysis) and K-table (e.g., STATIS, multiple coinertia analysis). The philosophy of the package is described in Dray and Dufour (2007) doi:10.18637/jss.v022.i04. 2.3 AER Functions, data sets, examples, demos, and vignettes for the book Christian Kleiber and Achim Zeileis (2008), Applied Econometrics with R, Springer-Verlag, New York. ISBN 978-0-387-77316-2. (See the vignette “AER” for a package overview.) 2.4 agridat Datasets from books, papers, and websites related to agriculture. Example graphics and analyses are included. Data come from small-plot trials, multi-environment trials, uniformity trials, yield monitors, and more. 2.5 alr4 Datasets to Accompany S. Weisberg (2014, ISBN: 978-1-118-38608-8), “Applied Linear Regression,” 4th edition. Many data files in this package are included in the alr3 package as well, so only one of them should be used. 2.6 boot Functions and datasets for bootstrapping from the book “Bootstrap Methods and Their Application” by A. C. Davison and D. V. Hinkley (1997, CUP), originally written by Angelo Canty for S. 2.7 carData Datasets to Accompany J. Fox and S. Weisberg, An R Companion to Applied Regression, Third Edition, Sage (2019). 2.8 datasets Base R datasets 2.9 dslabs Datasets and functions that can be used for data analysis practice, homework and projects in data science courses and workshops. 26 datasets are available for case studies in data visualization, statistical inference, modeling, linear regression, data wrangling and machine learning. 2.10 EnvStats Graphical and statistical analyses of environmental data, with focus on analyzing chemical concentrations and physical parameters, usually in the context of mandated environmental monitoring. Major environmental statistical methods found in the literature and regulatory guidance documents, with extensive help that explains what these methods do, how to use them, and where to find them in the literature. Numerous built-in data sets from regulatory guidance documents and environmental statistics literature. Includes scripts reproducing analyses presented in the book “EnvStats: An R Package for Environmental Statistics” (Millard, 2013, Springer, ISBN 978-1-4614-8455-4, https://www.springer.com/book/9781461484554). 2.11 fivethirtyeight Datasets and code published by the data journalism website ‘FiveThirtyEight’ available at https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data. Note that while we received guidance from editors at ‘FiveThirtyEight’, this package is not officially published by ‘FiveThirtyEight’. 2.12 FSAdata The datasets to support the Fish Stock Assessment (‘FSA’) package. 2.13 ggplot2 A system for ‘declaratively’ creating graphics, based on “The Grammar of Graphics”. You provide the data, tell ‘ggplot2’ how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details. 2.14 likert An approach to analyzing Likert response items, with an emphasis on visualizations. The stacked bar plot is the preferred method for presenting Likert results. Tabular results are also implemented along with density plots to assist researchers in determining whether Likert responses can be used quantitatively instead of qualitatively. See the likert(), summary.likert(), and plot.likert() functions to get started. 2.15 Lock5withR Data sets and other utilities for ‘Statistics: Unlocking the Power of Data’ by Lock, Lock, Lock, Lock and Lock (ISBN : 978-0-470-60187-7, http://lock5stat.com/). 2.16 MASS Functions and datasets to support Venables and Ripley, “Modern Applied Statistics with S” (4th edition, 2002). 2.17 mlbench A collection of artificial and real-world machine learning benchmark problems, including, e.g., several data sets from the UCI repository. 2.18 openintro Supplemental functions and data for ‘OpenIntro’ resources, which includes open-source textbooks and resources for introductory statistics (https://www.openintro.org/). The package contains data sets used in our open-source textbooks along with custom plotting functions for reproducing book figures. Note that many functions and examples include color transparency; some plotting elements may not show up properly (or at all) when run in some versions of Windows operating system. 2.19 Sleuth3 Data sets from Ramsey, F.L. and Schafer, D.W. (2013), “The Statistical Sleuth: A Course in Methods of Data Analysis (3rd ed)”, Cengage Learning. 2.20 tidyr Tools to help to create tidy data, where each column is a variable, each row is an observation, and each cell contains a single value. ‘tidyr’ contains tools for changing the shape (pivoting) and hierarchy (nesting and ‘unnesting’) of a dataset, turning deeply nested lists into rectangular data frames (‘rectangling’), and extracting values out of string columns. It also includes tools for working with missing values (both implicit and explicit). 2.21 vcd Visualization techniques, data sets, summary and inference procedures aimed particularly at categorical data. Special emphasis is given to highly extensible grid graphics. The package was package was originally inspired by the book “Visualizing Categorical Data” by Michael Friendly and is now the main support package for a new book, “Discrete Data Analysis with R” by Michael Friendly and David Meyer (2015). 2.22 vcdExtra Provides additional data sets, methods and documentation to complement the ‘vcd’ package for Visualizing Categorical Data and the ‘gnm’ package for Generalized Nonlinear Models. In particular, ‘vcdExtra’ extends mosaic, assoc and sieve plots from ‘vcd’ to handle ‘glm()’ and ‘gnm()’ models and adds a 3D version in ‘mosaic3d’. Additionally, methods are provided for comparing and visualizing lists of ‘glm’ and ‘loglm’ objects. This package is now a support package for the book, “Discrete Data Analysis with R” by Michael Friendly and David Meyer.

The Datasets by package dashboard, a 2017 ROpenSci unconference project by Andy Teucher, Richie Cotton, Claudia Vitolo, Jakub Nowosad, and Joe Stachelek was helpful for finding datasets to add. More specifically, this csv file led me to add the following packages: abd, agridat, EnvStats, FSAdata, Lock5withR, mlbench This bookdown project is very similar in nature. The main advantages of the current project are: 1) it is a curated list not produced by a bot, 2) the interface is more user-friendly, 3) it provides links to dataset help pages.
