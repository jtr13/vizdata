The complete list of output columns is as follows. Columns not initially visible can be viewed by clicking the Column Visibility button. Output columns package name of package (optional) name name of dataset nr_or_len number of rows or length() (whichever is not NULL) nc number of columns add_dim additional dimensions (&gt;= 3, such as for tables) first_class first class listed n_cols number of numeric columns i_cols number of integer columns f_cols number of factor columns c_cols number of character columns d_cols number of date columns other_cols number of other columns allclasses full list of classes (optional) Table columns can be sorted and filtered. Dataset names are linked to documentation if available. Datasets without links are usually included in documentation for a dataset in the same package with a similar name. For example, documentation for alr4::BGSboys and alr4::BGSgirls is included on the help page for alr4::BGSall. 1.0.2 Exploring data in packages locally The main function used here is data_xray() from the datacat package. You can explore datasets in R packages locally as follows. Install datacat: remotes::install_github(&quot;jtr13/datacat&quot;) View information with: library(datacat) data_xray(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) %&gt;% View() "],
