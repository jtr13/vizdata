The complete list of output columns is as follows. Columns not initially visible can be viewed by clicking the Column Visibility button. Output columns package name of package (optional) name name of dataset nr_or_len number of rows or length() (whichever is not NULL) nc number of columns add_dim additional dimensions (&gt;= 3, such as for tables) first_class first class listed n_cols number of numeric columns i_cols number of integer columns f_cols number of factor columns c_cols number of character columns d_cols number of date columns other_cols number of other columns allclasses full list of classes (optional) Table columns can be sorted and filtered. Dataset names are linked to documentation if available. Datasets without links are usually included in documentation for a dataset in the same package with a similar name. For example, documentation for alr4::BGSboys and alr4::BGSgirls is included on the help page for alr4::BGSall. 1.0.2 Exploring data in packages locally The main function used here is data_xray() from the datacat package. You can explore datasets in R packages locally as follows. Install datacat: remotes::install_github(&quot;jtr13/datacat&quot;) View information with: library(datacat) data_xray(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) %&gt;% View() "],

ISBN 978-0-387-77316-2. (See the vignette “AER” for a package overview.) 2.2 agridat Datasets from books, papers, and websites related to agriculture. Example graphics and analyses are included. Data come from small-plot trials, multi-environment trials, uniformity trials, yield monitors, and more. 2.3 alr4 Datasets to Accompany S. Weisberg (2014, ISBN: 978-1-118-38608-8), “Applied Linear Regression,” 4th edition. Many data files in this package are included in the alr3 package as well, so only one of them should be used. 2.4 boot Functions and datasets for bootstrapping from the book “Bootstrap Methods and Their Application” by A. C. Davison and D. V. Hinkley (1997, CUP), originally written by Angelo Canty for S. 2.5 dslabs Datasets and functions that can be used for data analysis practice, homework and projects in data science courses and workshops. 26 datasets are available for case studies in data visualization, statistical inference, modeling, linear regression, data wrangling and machine learning. 2.6 ggplot2 A system for ‘declaratively’ creating graphics, based on “The Grammar of Graphics”. You provide the data, tell ‘ggplot2’ how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details. 2.7 MASS Functions and datasets to support Venables and Ripley, “Modern Applied Statistics with S” (4th edition, 2002). 2.8 mlbench A collection of artificial and real-world machine learning benchmark problems, including, e.g., several data sets from the UCI repository. 2.9 tidyr Tools to help to create tidy data, where each column is a variable, each row is an observation, and each cell contains a single value. ‘tidyr’ contains tools for changing the shape (pivoting) and hierarchy (nesting and ‘unnesting’) of a dataset, turning deeply nested lists into rectangular data frames (‘rectangling’), and extracting values out of string columns. It also includes tools for working with missing values (both implicit and explicit). "],
